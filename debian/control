Description: Unified text diffing in Go (copy of gopls internal diffing)
 gotextdiff is a copy of the Go text diffing packages that the official Go
 language server gopls uses internally to generate unified diffs.
 .
 If you've previously tried to generate unified text diffs in Go (like
 the ones you see in Git and on GitHub), you may have found
 github.com/sergi/go-diff which is a Go port of Neil Fraser's
 google-diff-match-patch code - however it does not support unified diffs.
 .
 This is arguably one of the best (and most maintained) unified text
 diffing packages in Go as of at least 2020.
 .
 (All credit goes to the Go authors (http://tip.golang.org/AUTHORS), I am
 merely re-publishing their work so others can use it.)
